Nutrition Intelligence Agent (v1)

An AI-based Nutrition Assistant built with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.
The system answers nutrition-related questions strictly based on uploaded documents, without using external knowledge.

If the requested information is not explicitly present in the documents, the assistant responds transparently that it cannot answer.

Tech Stack
