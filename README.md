Nutrition Intelligence Agent (v1)
 Nutrition agent built with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.
 The system answers nutrition-related questions strictly based on uploaded documents, without using external knowledge.

 If the requested information is not explicitly present in the documents, the agent responds transparently that it cannot answer.
